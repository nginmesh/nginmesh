# NGINX Streaming Architecture with Istio Service Mesh
This repository provides an implementation of a NGINX based service mesh (nginMesh).  nginMesh is compatible with Istio.  It leverages NGINX as a sidecar proxy. 

## What is Service Mesh and Istio?
Please check https://istio.io for a detailed explanation of the service mesh.  

## Production Status
The current version of nginMesh is designed to work with Istio release 0.7.2. It should not be used in production environments.  

## Architecture
The diagram below depicts how an NGINX sidecar proxy is implemented. Sidecar uses the open source version of NGINX compiled with modules for tracing and monitoring.
In 0.7.2 release, nginMesh leverages Kafka for delivery traffic metrics across the Service Mesh. Security features, such as mTLS authentication are planned in upcoming releases.

To learn more about the sidecar implementation, see [this document](istio/agent).

## Quick Start
Below are instructions to quickly install and configure nginMesh.  Currently, only Kubernetes environment is supported.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster with at least 1.9 or greater due to fact only automatic sidecar injection is supported and no alpha feature is enabled. Please see [Prerequisites](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html) for setting up a kubernetes cluster.

### Installing Istio and nginMesh
nginMesh requires installation of Istio first.

1. Download and install Istio 0.7.1:
```
curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=0.7.2 sh -
```
2. Download nginMesh release 0.7.2:
```
curl -L https://github.com/nginmesh/nginmesh/releases/download/0.7.2/nginmesh-0.7.2.tar.gz | tar zx
```

3. Deploy Istio between sidecars:

```
kubectl create -f istio-0.7.2/install/kubernetes/istio.yaml
```


4. Ensure the following Kubernetes services are deployed: istio-pilot, istio-mixer, istio-ingress:
```
kubectl get svc  -n istio-system  
```
```
 NAME            CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)                       AGE
  istio-ingress   10.83.245.171   35.184.245.62     80:32730/TCP,443:30574/TCP    5h
  istio-pilot     10.83.251.173   <none>            8080/TCP,8081/TCP             5h
  istio-mixer     10.83.244.253   <none>            9091/TCP,9094/TCP,42422/TCP   5h
```

5. Ensure the following Kubernetes pods are up and running: istio-pilot-* , istio-mixer-* , istio-ingress-*  and istio-initializer-* :
```
kubectl get pods -n istio-system    
```
```
  istio-ca-3657790228-j21b9           1/1       Running   0          5h
  istio-ingress-1842462111-j3vcs      1/1       Running   0          5h
  istio-pilot-2275554717-93c43        1/1       Running   0          5h
  istio-mixer-2104784889-20rm8        2/2       Running   0          5h
```

6. Automatic sidecar:
To set up sidecar injection, please run following script which will install Istio webhook with nginMesh customization.
```
nginmesh-0.7.2/install/kubernetes/install-sidecar.sh
```

7. Verify that istio-injection label is not labeled for the default namespace :
```
kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection
```
```
NAME           STATUS        AGE       ISTIO-INJECTION
default        Active        1h        
istio-system   Active        1h        
kube-public    Active        1h        
kube-system    Active        1h
```

### Kafka deployment using Helm

1. Install the binary release of the Helm client depending on your OS.  Please follow [Setup guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart) for detailed instructions.

2. Install Helm server(Tiller) in Kubernetes cluster:
```
helm init
```
3. Make sure Tiller is up and running:

```
kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system
```
```
NAME                                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
tiller-deploy-f44659b6c-p48hf                        1/1       Running   0          51m
```

4. Run the following script to setup Kafka. It will be installed in 'kafka' namespace.  It is also possible to use existing kafka installation.

```
nginmesh-0.7.2/install/kafka/install.sh
```
Note: In GKE environment you may need to grant permission to default serviceaccount for cluster-wide access before install:

```
kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace kube-system tiller
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
kubectl patch deploy --namespace kube-system tiller-deploy -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccount":"tiller"}}}}'
```

5. Wait for a while and make sure all kafka and zookeeper pods are up and runnning:

```
kubectl get pods -n kafka
```
```
NAME                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-kafka-kafka-0       1/1       Running   1          15m
my-kafka-kafka-1       1/1       Running   0          13m
my-kafka-kafka-2       1/1       Running   0          12m
my-kafka-zookeeper-0   1/1       Running   0          15m
my-kafka-zookeeper-1   1/1       Running   0          14m
my-kafka-zookeeper-2   1/1       Running   0          14m
testclient             1/1       Running   0          15m
```
6. Check the deployed release status:

```
helm list
```
```
NAME    	         REVISION	         UPDATED                       	STATUS  	    CHART      	  NAMESPACE
my-kafka	           1           Tue Mar 27 18:45:18 2018	          DEPLOYED  	 kafka-0.4.7  	   kafka
```

7. Set up  topic named "nginmesh" by running below script:

```
nginmesh-0.7.2/tools/kafka-add-topics.sh nginmesh
```
8. View created topic by running below script:

```
nginmesh-0.7.2/tools/kafka-list-topics.sh
```
```
nginmesh
```

### Deploy a Sample Application
In this section we deploy the Bookinfo application, which is taken from the Istio samples. Please see [Bookinfo](https://istio.io/docs/guides/bookinfo.html)  for more details.

1. Label the default namespace with istio-injection=enabled:

```
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

2. Deploy the application:

```
kubectl apply -f  nginmesh-0.7.2/samples/bookinfo/kube/bookinfo.yaml
```

3. Confirm that all application services are deployed: productpage, details, reviews, ratings:

```
kubectl get services
```
```
NAME                       CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)              AGE
details                    10.0.0.31    <none>        9080/TCP             6m
kubernetes                 10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP              7d
productpage                10.0.0.120   <none>        9080/TCP             6m
ratings                    10.0.0.15    <none>        9080/TCP             6m
reviews                    10.0.0.170   <none>        9080/TCP             6m
```

4. Confirm that all application pods are running --details-v1-* , productpage-v1-* , ratings-v1-* , reviews-v1-* , reviews-v2-* and reviews-v3-* :
```
kubectl get pods
```
```
NAME                                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
details-v1-1520924117-48z17                 2/2       Running   0          6m
productpage-v1-560495357-jk1lz              2/2       Running   0          6m
ratings-v1-734492171-rnr5l                  2/2       Running   0          6m
reviews-v1-874083890-f0qf0                  2/2       Running   0          6m
reviews-v2-1343845940-b34q5                 2/2       Running   0          6m
reviews-v3-1813607990-8ch52                 2/2       Running   0          6m
```

5. Get the public IP of the Istio Ingress controller. If the cluster is running in an environment that supports external load balancers:

```
kubectl get svc -n istio-system | grep -E 'EXTERNAL-IP|istio-ingress'
```

OR

```
kubectl get ingress -o wide       
```

6. Open the Bookinfo application in a browser using the following link:
```
http://<Public-IP-of-the-Ingress-Controller>/productpage
```

Note: For E2E routing rules and performace testing you could refer to [E2E Test](istio/tests/README.md).
